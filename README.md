# Guess my number

[_Link to the game_](https://deiximar.github.io/guess-my-number/) 

A simple game about finding a randomly selected number between 1 and 20

You start with a score of 20 points and lose one point for each wrong guess. 

And there is a highscore so you can compete against yourself or your friends

## TODO
- Have different levels of difficulty, for example by increasing the max number to 1000 or more
- Save the highscore so it is not lost when the page is reloaded
